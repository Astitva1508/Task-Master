Why naming convention for apis is /api/v1/   ?
coz we might also be using the server to serve other type of things, like web pages(front-end). So it ensures seperation of concerns

app.use() adds middlewares to the applications request-processing pipeline

express.json() -> When a client sends an HTTP request to the server with a JSON payload, the request is first passed via it, and it converts the JSON string in the payload to a JSON object and populates the req.body property with the parsed JSON, which can be assessed in the application using the req.body object.

Collections equivalent to Tables in SQL Databases
// Database -> Collection -> Document

Mongoose is an Object Data Modelling Library 

Models here are simply representation of the collections present in MongoDB Cloud( provide an interface to the Collections in the DB)

once you set up a schema (using mongoose), only the properties that are specified in the schema are created for that object in the database, other properties are ignored

Always make sure to handle promises gracefully(i.e code for both try and catch)

General setup from the frontend on deleting some task is to call the api to get all tasks

What to return in response to a DELETE request?
res.status(200).json({task}); OR 
res.status(300).send();
res.status(300).json{{task:null, success:true}};

// express.static() is used to serve static files from the server

// What does new, runValidators and override options do in the findOneAndUpdate method?
// new returns the updated task value
// override used to create PUT-esque functionality, the properties which are not specified are removed


// General API response
res.json({
    status:"success/failure",
    data:{
        tasks,
        amount: tasks.length
    }
})

Express comes with a built-in error handler that takes care of any errors that might be encountered in the app. This default error-handling middleware function is added at the end of the middleware function stack.

If you pass an error to next() and you do not handle it in a custom error handler, it will be handled by the built-in error handler; the error will be written to the client with the stack trace.
